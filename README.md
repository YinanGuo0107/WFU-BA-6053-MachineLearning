MY CODE FOR BAN6053_MachineLearning
## Project 1 
This task is to build machine learning models to help identify likely churners for mobile phone companies like Verizon, ATT, etc. In this case, the company can incentivize the churners to stay with the company.
### Key Words
Logistic Regression / Decision Tree 
## Project 2
The financial institution needs to find fraud, waste and abuse in their payment stream. My job is to build models to identify important factors that can lead to frauds and make predictions to decide whether there will be new frauds in other data
### Key Words
Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest
## Project 3
This task is to help online job posting service detect fake job postings and prevent identity theft. We have previous job postings with labels of whether they are fake or not. I built a random forest model and an xgboost model to learn from past postings and to predict new postings
### Key Words
Random Forest / XGBoost / Sentiment Analysis / Term Frequency Encoding / Tune Grid / K-Fold Validation
## Project 4
CarVana needs DS team to detect bad purchase with used cars transactions through looking at their used car purchasing procecss. We're required to build and tune two models, a Random Forest and a XGBoost in this case.
### Key Words
Random Forest / XGBoost / Tune Grid / K-Fold Validation
## Project 5
In this project, our goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images, to be more specific, to identify hand written digits from 0 â€“ 9, which is a multi-classification problem. 
### Key Words
Neural Network / MLP / Random Forest / XGBoost / Tune Grid / K-Fold Validation
## Project 6
This task is to build machine learning models to help predict likely default loan for a major financial institution. In this case, we need to make sure the models are explainable and the predictions that we create can be explained
### Key Words
Random Forest / XGBoost / Tune Grid / K-Fold Validation /  Threshold Adjustment / Partial Dependency / Anomaly Detection
